Data Analyst (June 2022)SUMMARYDoe-Anderson is seeking a data analyst to join our growing analytics team. Candidate must possess a strong will to continually learn and grow in the field of data analysis, modeling, visualization, and innovation. Must be a curious individual willing to learn the field of marketing analytics to improve advertising campaigns for clients across all industries. PRIMARY DUTIES & RESPONSIBILITIES:· Develop measurement strategies: Under the direction of the Analytics Supervisor, you will create and execute campaign measurement plans by generating recommendations for digital user journey tracking and key performance indicators for cross-channel media plans.· Track and report performance and insights: You will monitor advertising campaign performance and develop reports and dashboards that clearly communicate the human behavior underlying the raw data to provide strategic recommendations.· Collaborate: In this role, you will work with clients across multiple industries and business models while collaborating with experts from multiple agency disciplines to ensure our reporting and insights reflect an integrated perspective.· Innovate: As a member of a highly skilled, growing team with a clear vision and drive toward innovation, you will be expected to strive to connect the dots and push forward new ideas for improvements within analytics and, more broadly, within the agency.· Maintain a growth mindset: Curiosity and constant learning are essential in this role. You will gain exposure to cutting-edge tools and methods (e.g., R programming, interactive dashboards, statistical modeling, etc.) and will be expected to develop skills in these areas.· Educate and empower colleagues: As you grow in your role as an analytics practitioner, you will train and encourage the agency and its clients to effectively interpret and apply basic analytics. Staying current with client and industry developments to continually push the agency forward is a must.REQUIREMENTS:· 1–3 years of experience in a related role.· Bachelor’s degree preferred, preferably in social sciences, economics, mathematics, statistics, business or marketing, or equivalent work experience demonstrating working knowledge and mastery of statistics and marketing analytics techniques as outlined above.· Basic knowledge of standard statistical concepts (probability, confidence intervals, p-values, t-tests, etc.).· Proficiency writing and presenting clear narrative presentations that summarize data insights, implications and recommended actions.· Candidate must currently reside in or be willing to relocate to the Louisville, Ky., area.PREFERRED EXPERIENCE:· Proficiency pulling and interpreting data from standard digital marketing platforms (Google Analytics, Google Ads, Facebook Business Manager, DoubleClick Campaign Manager, The Trade Desk, client databases, etc.).

About Louisville:  Our hometown since 1915 was recently dubbed “the new Austin.” We’re not sure what that means, but we’ll take it as a compliment. We like to think of Louisville as the place where Southern hospitality begins but Midwestern common sense and practicality stick around. It’s a blend of the best of both cultures. And speaking of culture, we’ve long been known for having one of the country’s most dynamic art scenes. Over the past decade, our food scene has caught up, with Louisville becoming recognized as one of the leaders in the farm-to-table movement. Oh, and did we mention bourbon? Mix in with a low cost of living and an ease of getting around. Stir well. Enjoy.  About Doe-Anderson: You know the cliché about a company being “like a family?” Well, sometimes clichés become clichés because they’re true. In the case of Doe-Anderson, you would be joining an organization that’s been nurturing careers (and the people attached to them) for well over a century. We like to think it’s because you can carve your own path here, supported by management and your peers. We try hard to keep the corporate politics to a minimum and the self-reliance to the max. That may be why almost half our employees are shareholders in the company – and why people tend to stick around nearly three times the ad agency average. There’s something about the place that makes it hard to leave.  At Doe-Anderson, we have a long history of creating work that, well, works. To do this, we strive to reflect the world we live in and speak to every day.
